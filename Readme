1. test.v is the test bench file.
2. Instructions are saved in files memory.v(to check arithmetic and logical R-type instructions) and memory1.v(to check jump,branch and load-save instructions)
3. Memory file is included in datapath.v file.
4. Output for memory.v is given in file output_memory and for memory1.v is   	given in output_memory1.
5. These outputs are generated by compiling using Icarus verilog in linux 	(Mint).
6. The output consists of following - 
	i. Current execution time.
	ii.Current value of Program counter.
	iii.Current Instruction.
	iv.Current values of registers A and B.
	v.Current value of ALU OUT register.
	vi.Current value in all the registers of Register file.
